# Data-Structure-and-Algorithm-in-C

A specified location that can be used to store and arrange data is called a data structure. Additionally, an algorithm is a series of procedures used to solve a certain problem. We may create computer programs that are effective and optimized by learning data structures and algorithms.

## Implemented data structure

1. Stack Using Array
2. Solving Postfix expressions using Stack
3. Implementing Queue using Array
4. Implementation of Circular Queue
5. Implementation of Linked list
6. Reversing Linked List
7. Implementing Stack using Linked List
8. Implementing Binary Search Tree

## Motivation

Data structure and algorithms were always a fascinating topic for me. College course inspired me to implement various data structure and corresponding algorithms.

## Technical Aspect

Used C for implementing data structures.
Techniques like recurssion are used to solve binary search tree.

## Personal Note

I really enjoyed implementing various algorithms. When trying to figure out how to implement various data structure, it was like a puzzle to me. A beautiful game !!
